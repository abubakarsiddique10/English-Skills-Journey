            "Hello, my name is Sam. I'm ten years old, and I live in England. There are six people in my family: my parents, two sisters, a brother, and me. My father, William, is an engineer, and my mother, Emma, is a school teacher. I enjoy spending time with my family, especially during holidays when we visit new places. I love learning English and reading books, especially stories about adventures and mysteries. My favorite subjects in school are Math and Computer Science because I enjoy solving problems and creating things. I also like coding and exploring new technologies, trying to build small apps and websites. In my free time, I play football with my friends at the local park, and Iâ€™m also learning how to swim. I have a pet dog named Bogey, who is very playful and loves running around in the garden. One day, I hope to become a software engineer. That's all about me.",
