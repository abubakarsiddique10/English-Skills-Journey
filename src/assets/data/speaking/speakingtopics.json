I also like coding and exploring new technologies, trying to build small apps and websites.</p> <p>In my free time, I play football with my friends at the local park, and Iâ€™m also learning how to swim. I have a pet dog named Bogey, who is very playful and loves running around in the garden. One day, I hope to become a software engineer. That's all about me.</p>"

I get up early in the morning, around 6 AM. After waking up, I wash my face and then go for a walk with my father, enjoying the fresh air and the quiet of the morning. When I return home, I take a bath. After that, I have my breakfast, usually something healthy like toast, eggs, or fruit. After breakfast, I always brush my teeth. I make sure to reach school on time, as punctuality is important to me. I attend all my classes.</p> <p>I return home at 4 PM. In the afternoon, I play football or cricket with friends at the local playground. It's a great way to stay fit and have fun. In the evening, I study for some time. Then I watch TV. After supper, I go to bed early, following the golden rule of 'early to bed and early to rise.' I strictly follow my daily routine because it helps me stay focused and disciplined.</p> <p>However, On holidays, my routine changes. Sometimes, I visit the zoo with my parents, where I enjoy seeing different animals, and other times, I spend the day at my relatives' house, catching up with my cousins and having fun. However, I never break the golden rule of 'early to bed and early to rise'.</p>"
